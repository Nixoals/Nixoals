# ABOUT ME
:wave: Hi, my name is Nicolas. I am a tech anthusiast and passionated about science and programming. 

After a P.h.D and several years as a research ingeneer in geochemistry, I decided to deep dive into this new digital era to become a web developer. To do so, I started to learn python, javascript, HTML, CSS by myself. I then embarked for a 10 weeks coding bootcamp at LE REACTEUR to strengthen my coding skills. I am now open to work and ready for challenging projects.
